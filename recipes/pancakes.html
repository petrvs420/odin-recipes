    <h2>Description</h2>
    Homemade pancakes are a treat, but they are surprisingly 
    simple to whip up. Our easy pancake recipe uses ingredients 
    you likely have on hand, like all-purpose flour, baking powder, 
    sugar, butter, and egg. Start with our basic recipe, or try one 
    of our variations using buttermilk or yogurt. Either way, 
    you'll have a fluffy stack ready to eat in less than half an hour
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; 
                have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready 
                to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven.
